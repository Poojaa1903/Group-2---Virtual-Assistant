# Group-2---Virtual Assistant
This project is being developed by Group 2 as part of the Post Graduate Diploma in Big Data Analytics (PG-DBDA) program. The goal is to create an intelligent virtual assistant for the official SM VITA website to enhance user experience by providing instant support, answering FAQs, and assisting with navigation.

**Problem Statement:**
This project aims to develop an intelligent chatbot powered by AWS services to provide accurate, context-aware responses about CDAC and its courses to prospective candidates. The chatbot will serve as an interactive tool (UI) to answer common queries, offering detailed information about CDAC's programs, eligibility criteria, application processes, and key dates. The knowledge base will be created using publicly available resources, including data gathered through web scraping from official websites and other relevant sources. Additionally, a sample set of expected user questions will need to be gathered to ensure the chatbot is trained effectively. To maintain professionalism and safety, the chatbot will have to adhere to strict guidelines to avoid responding to irrelevant or potentially dangerous questions, ensuring all interactions remain focused, accurate, and secure.
